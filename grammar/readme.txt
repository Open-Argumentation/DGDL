An EBNF distinguishes only between terminal and non-terminal symbols whilst an ANTLR grammar also disinguishes between lexer rules and parser rules. In this repository, EBNF grammars use the suffix .ebnf whilst antlr grammars use the suffix .g and both EBNF and ANTLR grammars are included within the repository because, generally, an EBNF grammar is more succinct and human-readable than the equivalent ANTLR grammar.
