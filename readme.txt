The Dialogue Game Description Language (DGDL)

The Dialogue Game Description Language (DGDL) is an EBNF grammar for describing and subsequently verifying the syntactic correctness of the rules of dialogue game protocols. These protocols are based broadly, but not exclusively, upon the approach to dialogue games due to Hamblin (1970) which characterised argumentative dialogue as a kind of two-player turn-taking game called a formal dialectical game.
